  Create a function named towerOfHanoi that takes an integer parameter representing the number of disks.
The function should return a String array containing the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle in the fewest possible moves.

Each String in the array should consist of two characters — each being one of the letters L, M, or R — representing the pegs Left, Middle, and Right, respectively.

The first character indicates the peg from which a disk is moved.

The second character indicates the peg to which the disk is moved.

The moves should be listed in the order they are performed, with index 0 representing the first move.
